## The Basics

> Effective altruism is about answering one simple question: how can we use our resources to help others the most?
> 
> Rather than just doing what feels right, we use evidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes to work on.

> Working on a cause is likely to be high impact to the extent that it is:
>
> * _Great in scale_ (it affects many people’s lives, by a great amount)
> * _Highly neglected_ (few other people are working on addressing the problem), and
> * _Highly solvable_ (additional resources will do a great deal to address it).
